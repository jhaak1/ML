This repository consists of two R Markdown PDF files: 
1.  Novozymes.pdf shows the code for one of my entries in the Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction Kaggle competition.  For this submission, I used a single layer neural network to predict the melting temperatures of peptides.  The file has seven pages.
2.  S3E11.pdf shows my approach to the Kaggle Playground - Season 3, Episode 11 competition, in which I used a random forest model to predict cost based on 16 variables.  This file has 17 pages.
